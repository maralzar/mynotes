# Personal Notes and Ideas

## Purpose
This repository serves as a centralized place to store my personal notes, comments, and creative ideas. It’s a digital notebook for brainstorming, tracking thoughts, and organizing concepts for future reference or projects.

## Structure
- **Notes/**: Contains individual markdown files for each topic (e.g., `cuda.md`, `linux.md`, `deep-learning.md`). Each file focuses on a specific subject, such as CUDA, Linux, or Deep Learning.
- **Ideas/**: Dedicated folder for creative ideas, project concepts, or inspirations.
- **Comments/**: Stores feedback, reflections, or commentary on specific subjects or resources.
- **Archive/**: For outdated or completed notes/ideas that I want to retain for reference.

## Usage
- **Adding Notes**: Create a new markdown file in the `Notes/` folder for each topic, named after the topic (e.g., `cuda.md`, `linux.md`, `deep-learning.md`). Use headers, lists, or tables to organize content within each file.
- **Recording Ideas**: Add a new file in the `Ideas/` folder. Include a title, description, and any relevant tags or categories.
- **Commenting**: Store comments or feedback in the `Comments/` folder, referencing the subject (e.g., a book, article, or project).
- **Tagging**: Use tags like `#brainstorm`, `#project`, or `#research` within files to make searching easier. Include topic-specific tags like `#cuda`, `#linux`, or `#deep-learning`.
- **Search**: Use the repository’s search functionality or grep to find specific notes or ideas by keywords, tags, or topic names.
